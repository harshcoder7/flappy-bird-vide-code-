# Flappy Bird - React Edition

A modern, web-based implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, built from the ground up using **React**.  
This project demonstrates how to structure a game as a web application with components, state management, and interactive features.

This application was created as a demonstration of building a complete, interactive game within a modern web framework.

## 🎮 Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the core Flappy Bird mechanics.
- **Animated Bird**: The bird's wings flap for a more dynamic visual feel.
- **Parallax Background**: Scrolling clouds create a sense of depth and motion.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for flapping, scoring, and collisions, generated with Tone.js.
- **High Score Tracking**: Your best score is saved locally in your browser using `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts cleanly to different screen sizes.
